Welcome!



This is a demo app for the experimental markup language L0.

[i To see what
you can do with L0, compare the left and right windows (source
and rendered text)].  Clicking on text on the right brings the
corresponding text on the left into view.  For the reverse,
highlight text on the left and click the [b[blue Sync]] button,
lower left.

You can also click on the titles in [b [blue Published docs]] (right column) to see what has been written already in L0.


[i [blue Try out L0 now: just begin typing in the left window. Delete all the text if you want.  Don't worry â€” your edits won't be saved, since you don't own this document.]]

3. Some math: Pythagoras sez $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.  In class we
learned that

$$
\\int_0^1 x^n dx = \\frac{1}{n+1}
$$

4. Some code: `a[0] := a[0] + 1`.  A block of code:

|| code
>>> for i in range(1,5):
...   print(i, i*i)
...
1 1
2 4
3 9
